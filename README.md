The repository contains solved assignmnets for the Tensor Flow Specialiazation on Coursera by deeplearning.ai

### 1. Introduction to Tensor Flow for AI, ML and Deep Learning

* Over the course of thhe first course of Specialization the development of deep CNN is acheived for classification of various data sets.
* Extra techniques such as Image Generator, Pooling and Callbacks were used.
* Visualization was used to see what actually happens in the Convulation process.

The image shows intermediate convulations of the Fashion MNIST data set for an image of a shoe. The lace and the sole part are convulated for better classification.

### 2. Convulational Neural Networks in TensoeFlow

* This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. 
* You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. 
*Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
