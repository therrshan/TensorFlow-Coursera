# TensorFlow-Coursera
The repository contains solved assignmnets for the Tensor Flow Specialiazation on Coursera by deeplearning.ai

### 1. Introduction to Tensor Flow for AI, ML and Deep Learning

* Over the course of thhe first course of Specialization the development of deep CNN is acheived for classification of various data sets.
* Extra techniques such as Image Generator, Pooling and Callbacks were used.
* Visualization was used to see what actually happens in the Convulation process.
