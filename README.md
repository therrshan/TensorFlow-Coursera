### 1. Introduction to Tensor Flow for AI, ML and Deep Learning

* Over the course of thhe first course of Specialization the development of deep CNN is acheived for classification of various data sets.
* Extra techniques such as Image Generator, Pooling and Callbacks were used.
* Visualization was used to see what actually happens in the Convulation process.

The image shows intermediate convulations of the Fashion MNIST data set for an image of a shoe. The lace and the sole part are convulated for better classification.

### 2. Convulational Neural Networks in TensorFlow

* This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. 
* You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. 
* Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.

The images show the validation to train accuracy graphs for the four different models that we train through out the course.

### 3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

* In this third course, you’ll learn how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. 
* You’ll learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it’s recognizable by a neural network. 
* You’ll be introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how you can train them to understand the meaning of text. 
* Finally, you’ll learn how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!

The course completion is quiz based but the pracitice assignments are provided in the repository.

### 4. Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction

* In this fourth course, you will learn how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow. 
* You’ll first implement best practices to prepare data for time series learning. You’ll also explore how RNNs and ConvNets can be used for predictions. 
*Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!

The course completion is quiz based but the pracitice assignments are provided in the repository.
